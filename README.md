# AssetGen

AssetGen is a tool designed to streamline the localization process for iOS and Android platforms and asset management for iOS.
It provides a unified solution for generating localization files from a single source, Google Sheets.

There are several benefits of using the tool:

- Unified translation system for iOS and Android platforms

- Seamless integration with project workflows for automatic translation imports

- Minimized risk of typo errors in localization usage

- Enhanced productivity through intelligent auto-completion and semantic clarity

- Safeguard against referencing non-existent assets
